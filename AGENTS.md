# Guidelines for Working with AI Assistant Feedback

This repository uses **gemini-code-assist** to provide review suggestions.
Please address all suggestions from the AI assistant. If a suggestion is not implemented, provide a brief justification in the pull request discussion.

All new functions must include corresponding unit tests. If unit testing is not feasible for a particular function, a clear explanation should be provided.
